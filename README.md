- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdiZ-CSharp
I have learned C# and Python to a moderate level. I like to post my source code here for others to see, to help them with their development in Coding.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding (would you believe it), and especially Python for the time being, as I started out learning learning C# and now I want to try and wrap my head around Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the programming language Python, and how to program simple applications in it.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my YouTube (AdiZ), or my Twitter (@ztech58).
