- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdiZ-CSharp
I have a YouTube channel that I like to post occasional Coding tutorials on. Some of my repositories will be linked in my YouTube channel, and I like to post my source code here for others to see, to help them with their development in Coding.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding (would you believe it), and especially C# for the time being, as that's the language I started out learning, and the one I'm still using (as of the start of 2022).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the programming language C#, and how to program using WinForms and, more recently, WPF.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my YouTube, or my Twitter (@ztech58).
